# Plant Disease Detection

## Overview
This tool enables users to upload a photo of a plant's leaf to determine whether it is healthy or diseased. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, the tool provides accurate classification of the leaf's condition.

## Tools and Technologies Used

### Deep Learning
- A classification model trained on a dataset of over 3,000 images to ensure high accuracy in identifying diseased leaves.

### Hue Moment Analysis
- Extracts color-based features from leaf images, aiding in distinguishing between healthy and diseased leaves.

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Analyzes visual patterns and textures, providing robust feature extraction and classification.

## Key Features
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload leaf images directly for analysis.
- **Disease Detection**: The model identifies whether the plant is healthy or shows signs of disease.
- **Multi-Feature Analysis**: Combines hue moment and CNN-based insights for improved accuracy.
- **High Accuracy**: The large dataset and diverse training approach ensure reliable predictions.

## How It Works
1. **Upload an Image**: Provide a clear image of a plant's leaf.
2. **Analyze**: The tool processes the image using advanced machine learning techniques.
3. **Result**: Get a prediction indicating whether the leaf is healthy or diseased.

This tool is designed to assist in early detection of plant diseases, enabling timely intervention to maintain plant health.
